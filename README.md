# Project Boilerplate

This project contains a template to use when creating a new project. It comes with all the standard files which there is expected to be in an open source project on Github. 

## How to use

1. Clone this project and copy the files into your own project
2. Start developing!
3. Ensure you are in compliance with Mobiliar Open-Source Developer Guide 
4. If in doubt, get in touch with opensource@mobi.ch

## Readme template

Below you can find a complete readme template for a project (based on [work](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) by [@PurpleBooth](https://github.com/PurpleBooth)), this will help you communicate the vision and goals of the project as well as answering common questions from future contributors.

The readme file is the single most important documentation of your project, so make sure you spend time on giving a great first impression to new users and provide the needed information to interested contributors.

# _projectname_

_description_

Describe what this project does. Keep this language human and friendly, so avoid internal references, acronyms and if you 
have dependencies, provide a direct link to these.

When describing features of your project, remember to explain why these are a benefit and advantage to the user:

```
This project allows you to scale X (feature) in a fast and predictable way (benefit) - meaning you will use fewer resources and can be confident in your X environment (Advantage).
```

Think about your project as a product, consider who your audience is, and how your decisions affect the number of potential users, below is a handy checklist of things to consider before open sourcing any code. 

- **Avoid internal dependencies** Obviously projects that require Mobi specific infrastructure, configuration or process have very limited use to anyone outside die Mobiliar. 
- **Avoid narrow usecases** Does this solve a Mobiliar-only problem or does it have broader application - are there things you could change to make it a more general product
- **Have a Product vision** Do you know where you want to take this product? - then be open about it so future contributors are aware. Being opinionated is great and it helps set expectations and the direction for the project
- **Take ownership** Are you are benevolent dictator or open to anything? - consider how you will interact with future contributors who expect you to be an active maintainer
- **Safe defaults** How do people get up and running - are there a lot of ceremony involved or can you provide a simple out of the box experience, so it is easy for users to evaluate your project


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
If possible, provide a quick exemple of how to get this running with minimal effort, so anyone curious can get up and running as fast as possible 
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
